title: Websocket API
category: general
difficulty: hard
toc: true
---

The VRChat Websocket API (a.k.a. "Pipeline") is used receiving updates regarding the API, such as receiving an invite request.
The WebSocket is **receive-only**, meaning that you can only listen for messages. Sending messages is undefined behavior.

## Connecting

Connecting to the VRChat webhook server is done via the URL:
`wss://pipeline.vrchat.cloud/?authToken=authcookie_...`

The auth-token query parameter is the authorization cookie you receive when logging into VRChat.
A proper User-Agent is also required to connect to the websocket server.
It is possible to be connected from multiple locations at the same time. All clients will receive the exact same messages.

> **ℹ️ Most messages are double-encoded!**
>
> All notification `content` values will be documented in JSON object form. The "`content`" frield is a **stringified** version of the JSON object, and needs to be unpacked separately. _(with the exception of `see-notification` and `hide-notification` events, which take a notification ID instead.)_
>
> ```json
> {
>     "type": "notification",
>     "content": "{\"userId\": \"usr_...\"}"
> }
> ```

## Note on Enumerations

Several JSON string values present in both Websocket API messages and HTTP API responses appear to be contained in predictably consistent sets.
Throughout both APIs, the empty string `""` is returned in places (including the immediately) where it would seem otherwise reasonable to have a `null` or undefined value.
In this part of the documentation, the following `":identifier"`s will be used to describe possible enumeration-ish values:

- `":locationString"`
    - `""` Pseudo-null value
    - `"offline"` Implies a user currently is not either running the VRChat client or connected to the Pipeline (e.g., browser tab open)
    - `"traveling"` Indicates a user's client is travelling between instances (e.g., downloading world, synchronizing world state)
        - Also can be `"traveling:traveling`
    - `"private"` Indicates a user's location is not visible to the currently logged-in user. (e.g., Ask Me/Do Not Disturb status, Invite/Invite+/Group instance)
    - *other values* An actual location (see https://vrchatapi.github.io/tutorials/instances/)
- `":platformString"`
    - `""` Pseudo-null value
    - `"standalonewindows"`
    - `"android"`
    - `"web"` User is on a https://vrchat.com/home page
    - *other values* Some other platform or third-party application (e.g., `"ios"` could be the value for a future build on some Apple devices)
- `":contentRefreshContentTypeEnum"`
    - `"gallery"`
    - `"icon"`
    - `"emoji"`
    - `"print"`
    - `"prints"` is also a value observed, but this never has an id attached
    - `"sticker"`
    - `"inventory"` appears to mirror other 
    - `"avatar"`
    - `"world"`
    - *other values* Some other user-uploaded content
- `":contentRefreshActionTypeEnum"`
    - `"created"`
    - `"deleted"`
    - `"add"` \*
    - `"delete"` \*
    - *other values* Not expected<br>
      \* *only observed with* `"inventory"` *content type*
- `":inventoryType"`
    - `"sticker"`
    - *other values* Some other user-uploaded or creator economy content

## Events

### Notification Events

#### notification
A "`notification`" event carries a Notification object, and are used by Invites, Friend Requests and other in-game notifications.

```json

    "type": "notification",
    "content": {
        // <Notification Object>, See return data of Notification API:

    }
}
```

#### response-notification
The "`response-notification`" event is used to respond to a previously sent event.
It carries an ID of the response notification "`responseId`", whereby the data is required to be fetched from the API.
It also carries "`notificationId`" to indicate which notification this is a response to.

```json
{
    "type": "response-notification",
