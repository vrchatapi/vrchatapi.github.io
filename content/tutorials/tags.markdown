Tags are a way to grant access, assign restrictions, or attach other kinds of metadata to various to objects e.g. worlds, users and avatars.
These tags are in the form of simple strings, grouped together in a string array, and commonly prefixed with a namespace designating the type of tag.

Tags starting with `admin_` are always assigned to the user manually by a staff. Tags starting with `system_` are automatically assigned by the system.

Trust rank tags have an offset of 1 with their name, so `system_trust_trusted` is actually only `Known User` (orange). The arrows in the following picture highlight the offset naming inaccuracy. The naming system is because of legacy reasons. Visistors have no trust rank at all. It is common for people User and above to be missing the tag for New User.

These are not listed because it would be impossible to accurately keep such list up-to-date, and each tag is of little use outside of that specific event.
