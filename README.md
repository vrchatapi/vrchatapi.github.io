# 💙 VRChat API Documentation 💙

Welcome to the VRChat API Documentation Project! This project is an [OPEN Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org) where we strive to document the VRChat's Web API, and thereby enable of developers to programmatically interact with VRChat and develop amazing new programs, Discord bots and websites!

## 🔰 Getting Started

**Check out the REST API documentation at: https://vrchatapi.github.io/**

Or if you are simply looking to **use** the VRChat API, please instead check out one of the language libraries:

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Before we begin, we would like to state this is a **COMMUNITY DRIVEN PROJECT**.
This means that everything you read on here was written by the community itself and is **not** officially supported by VRChat.
The documentation is provided "AS IS", and any action you take towards VRChat is completely your own responsibility.

The documentation and additional libraries SHALL ONLY be used for applications interacting with VRChat's API in accordance
with their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) and [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and MUST NOT be used for modifying the client, "avatar ripping", or other illegal activities.
Malicious usage or spamming the API may result in account termination.
Certain parts of the API are also more sensitive than others, for example moderation, so please tread extra carefully and read the warnings when present.

Finally, use of the API using applications other than the approved methods (website, VRChat application, Unity SDK) is not officially supported.
VRChat provides no guarantee or support for external applications using the API. Access to API endpoints may break **at any time, without notice**.
Therefore, please **do not ping** VRChat Staff in the VRChat Discord if you are having API problems, as they do not provide API support.

## 💖 Contributing (Help wanted!)

Do you want to help with documenting the API? The work we do today build upon the work done by predecessors years ago. We are standing on the shoulders of giants. If you help out, then one day people will greatly appreciate the work you've done in helping them to create even greater innovations.

It is beautiful developing API documentation, not only because it will help yourself in your own projects, but because it allows others to create stuff you yourself wouldn't even think of, thereby greatly improving the experience for everyone! If that sounds amazing, please [contact on Discord](https://discord.gg/qjZE9C9fkB) and we can help you get started!
